This is a basic script to help make it easier to compile / decompile your jar files. The menu is pretty straight forward.

To use: stick the target jar file you plan on using in the put-jar-file-here folder. Then in terminal type

    chmod +x menu

and execute the script by typing:

    ./menu

Follow the onscreen instructions and you'll have a working /classout folder or classes.dex file to work with
